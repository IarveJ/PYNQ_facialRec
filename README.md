# PYNQ Facial Recognition Implementation
Miami University ECE 387 Spring 2018 Midterm Project
Author: Jacob Iarve

## Getting Started
### Introduction
For my midterm project, I have interfaced the Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 with a webcam and an HDMI output.
Using PYNQ, it is easy to create overlays that abstract low-level FPGA logic into high 
level languages such as Python 3. Using overlays to program in Python, I installed a Python Facial 
Recognition package that I used to create a Facial Recognition Security System.
### Built With
* OpenCV 2 - Comes installed on PYNQ board.
* [Ageitgey Facial Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) -Facial Recognition Library Used
* [PYNQ Board](https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ) -PYNQ Board Libraries
