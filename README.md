Miami University ECE 387 Spring 2018 Midterm Project
Author: Jacob Iarve

# Introduction
For my midterm project, I have interfaced the Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 Board with a webcam and an HDMI output.
Using the PYNQ board, it is easy to create overlays that abstract low-level FPGA logic into high 
level languages such as Python 3. Using overlays, I installed a Python Facial Recognition package 
that I used to create a Facial Recognition Security System.

Integrating the following
